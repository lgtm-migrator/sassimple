> Fill in your `css` gaps & with awesome `scss` mixins

üõ† &nbsp;Sassimple is a buffet of the best most supported `sass` mixins with **0% css inprint after it has been compiled**!

## Install

```
bower install sassimple
```

```
npm install sassimple
```

## Setup

```css
@import 'node_modules/sassimple/mixins/sassimple';
```
\* Above, is just the easiest path to using üõ† &nbsp;**Sassimple** but you can set it up how you'd like.

## Use

```css
.button {
  @include button; 
  // .button will now have button styles from bourbon - http://bourbon.io/docs/#buttons
}
```

## Philosophy

- Use popular `scss` mixins to solve css problems.
- Fully use a css framework or don't - Sassimple is just mixins.

## Why

- You don't want to use a css framework but want a css framework's conventions
- You want to have lots of ready to use mixins at your service whether you use them or not

## \*Mixin Reference

- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) (without the framework's css classes) for _normalization_ to the most used ui library on the internet, 
- [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) for styles helpers like _css transitions_, 
- [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) for a faceless (no css classes) grid, 
- [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) for autoprefixing stuff & other helpers & 
- [Sassline](https://sassline.com/) for font sizes & lineheights. 
- [Sassimple](https://github.com/yowainwright/sassimple/tree/master/mixins) to add to the layer cake of supported mixins

\* Sassimple easy reference coming soon.
