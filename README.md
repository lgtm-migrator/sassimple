> Fill in your `css` gaps & with awesome **already done** work that (using `scss` mixins)

üõ† &nbsp;Sassimple pulls in sass mixin libraries & adds mixins of its own to help you write your sass faster. 

**Sassimple** brings in **[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)** (without css classes) for _normalization_ to the most used ui library on the internet, **[Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/)** for styles helpers like _css transitions_, **[Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/)** for a faceless (no css classes) grid, **[Compass](http://compass-style.org/)** for autoprefixing stuff & other helpers, **[Sassline](https://sassline.com/)** for font sizes & lineheights **AND THEN** üõ†&nbsp;&nbsp;**Sassimple** adds a few more common mixins to do to complex things. 

## Install

```
bower install sassimple
```

```
npm install sassimple
```

## Setup

üìå &nbsp;Once you've imported üõ† &nbsp;**Sassimple**, you can `@import` your `_sassimple.scss` parial how you'd like

```css

@import 'node_modules/sassimple/mixins/sassimple';

```
\* Above, is just the easiest path üõ† &nbsp;**Sassimple**. You'd can set it up how you'd like.

### Super Easy Use Case

```css

.button {
  @include button; 
  // .button will now have browser defaults removed
  // you can checkout the mixin to further styles
}

```

## Philosophy

- Use `Scss` mixins to fill in your simple _or_ to solve some more complex css problems.
- Use _Sassimple_ mixins or don't.
- Use a css framework or don't.
- üõ† **0% css inprint on install**

## Why

- The need the use frameworks while simultaneously not wanting their overhead for things the project doesn't need 
- The need to have a place to quickly reference already written awesome sass mixins

## Examples

### 1. Code parity use case

> Writing a mixin in a code parity pattern

In this example a button mixin is used *_normalize_ `<button>` styles.

\* normalize: just means making it behave the same. _Normalizing_ is often done for browsers but it can also be done for team succinctness as well.  

Here's a mixin
```css
@mixin button ($backgrondColor = transparent, $padding = 0, $border = 0, $margin = 0, $outline: 0, $padding = 0) {
		background-color: $backgrondColor;
    border: $border;
    cursor: pointer;
    margin: $margin;
    outline: $outline;
    padding: $padding;
}

```

& HTML
```html
<form class="checkout">
    <button class="checkout__button checkout__button--finish"></button>
</form>
```

with SCSS
```css
.checkout {
	&--button {
		@include button(you, got, it, all);
		&--finish{
			css-rule: and-then-some;
		}
	}
}
```
- No framework css classes required but you can use them if you'd like.
- üõ† &nbsp;&nbsp;**Solved:** &nbsp;You now have a basic button normalization

### 2. Do more complex stuff 

> Use a mixin to do complex css

In this example we'll middle align a div 

Here's a mixin
```css
@mixin middle-align($position: absolute) {
  left: 50%;
  position: $position;
  top: 50%;
  @include prefix(transform, translate(-50%, -50%), webkit ms moz);
} 
```

& HTML
```html
<div>
	<div class="middle-align"></div>
</div>
```

with SCSS
```css
.middle-align {
	@include middle-align;
}
```
- üõ† &nbsp;&nbsp;**Solved:** &nbsp;After minor tweaking, you'll no longer have to think about middle aligning anything.

*Note:* sass is fundamentally a ruby gem so there is inherently an extra build step with *Sassimple*. However, the convenience of _lots_ of battle tested mixins after an exta setup step easily makes it worthwhile. + *Sassimple* has it's own helper mixins.

## More Basic Sassimple setup examples

### Reference the `_sassimple.scss` partial right from `bower` or `npm`:

```css

// in sass file (with bower)
@import 'bower_components/sassimple/mixins/sassimple';

// or (with npm)
@import 'node_modules/sassimple/mixins/sassimple';

```

### Reference Sassimple more cleaning in a build tool (like gulp as demonstrated here):

```javascript
  var gulp = require('gulp');
  var sass = require('gulp-sass');
  var sassGlob = require('gulp-sass-glob');

  gulp.task('styles', function() {
  return gulp
    .src('client/src/styles/**/*.scss')
    .pipe(sassGlob())
    .pipe(sass({
      extension: 'scss',
      includePaths: [
        'bower_components/sassimple/'
      ]
    }).on('error', sass.logError))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('/* your desired file path */'));

  gulp.task('default', ['styles']);

```

## If
- You'd like mixins added
- Other libraries added (that don't add a `css` footprint on inclusion)
- Feel a mixin could be done better - submit a PR.
- üõ† **Sassimple** will continue improving üëç.
